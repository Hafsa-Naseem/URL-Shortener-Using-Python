This is a simple Python script to shorten URLs using the PyShorteners library. The script uses the TinyURL shortening service to shorten the input URL.

Before running the script, you need to make sure that you have installed the PyShorteners library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: 
pip install pyshorteners
After running the code, it will ask you to enter the URL you want to shorten and then after running it will display the shortened URL.
